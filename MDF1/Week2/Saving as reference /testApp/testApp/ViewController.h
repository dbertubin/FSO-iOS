//Instructions

//This project again allows you to come up with your own application theme and topic. You will be using some of the new controls that you've learned as well as things we've covered in previous weeks.
//

//You will be using Full Sail's online Library at https://orgsync.com/50450/chapter. Click on the Research Databases link on the right. Use one of the databases to research your topic.
//

//Your project will include a UITableViewController with selectable data. Each item selected should present a detail UIView. This detail UIView should show information from an entry you found in the database and must include the URL to that entry.
//

//NOTE** Please make sure your code is easy to follow and use code comments

//Your project will need to have the following features:

//A UITabBarControl with at least three tabs.

//One of the tabs must contain a UINavigationController.

//The child of navigation controller can contain any UI you wish but must have an option to push another view onto the navigationController stack.

//One tab must use a UITableViewController and contain selectable data. This selectable data MUST then present a detail UIView displaying most information about this item. The information should come from an entry you found in one of Research Databases in Full Sail's online Library. The URL to the database entry must be included.

//One tab can be free form UI.

//Make sure to add in a default.png graphic and icon.

//Draw up a quick flow diagram of your UI and include it in your project.

//Please make sure that your project compiles as any project turned in without code that builds completely will receive a 0.
